I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France and we mourn
their loss as a nation and as far as turkey is concerned
so many friends and turkey great people amazing people
we wish them well it looks like they're resolving the difficulty but we wish
them well a lot of a lot of anguish last night but hopefully it'll all work out
now as hopefully the next president of the United States
I want to refer back to what's happened over the years the Middle East today is
more unstable than ever before
never been like this out of control after four years of clinton who really
led the way and let Obama down a horrible path because I don't even think
he could have made these decisions so badly she let him write down a horrible
path he didn't know what he was doing
Iraq Syria all in decay of us and iran is on a path the nuclear weapons and on
top of that we gave them back 150 billion dollars and we didn't get our
hostages until the end
now we're seeing unrest in Turkey a further demonstration of the failures of
Obamacare
you just have to look every single thing they touched has turned to horrible
horrible death defying problems
we also need to bring back in this country as we see what happened
our industry our manufacturing our jobs they've been taken away like were babies
take it away and we're gonna bring him back
I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and your price
process really prosperous society for all Americans
Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first to us
I've admired the work he's done especially in the state of Indiana and
i'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute but I
also admire the fact that he fights to the people and he's going to fight for
you is a solid solid person
governor pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress heroes to
leadership and served as the chairman of the entire house republican conference
number one
he's really got the skills of a highly talented executive leading the state of
Indiana two jobs growth and opportunity in spite of the relentless obstacles put
in his way and every States way by the Obama administration
it's horrible out there high taxes and regulations and it's out of control
Mike Pence is a man of honor character and honesty
we know that Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption she's a corrupt
person
what she's done with her emails what she's done with so many things and I see
the ads up all the time the ends
she's totally bought and paid for by wall street the special interests and
lobbyists one hundred percent
she's crooked Hillary
yeah
and I think that while she got away with murder fact I think it might be her
greatest accomplishment escaping the recent scandal and her lies and the loss
of 33,000 emails but it wasn't a loss
she just started that in itself is a major crime
other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they've done which is
peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton 33 thousand emails are
missing and that's okay
didn't give them to the FBI didn't give them to the Attorney General and that's
okay
wipes your server clean that's okay
these are crimes these are crimes and how she got away with it
i think i understand it but i think a lot of people don't but I do believe
while she didn't pay the price you pay she's going to pay that price when
november eight rolls around
she's very good at the Paris
yeah
on top of everything else Hillary made 21.6 million dollars giving speeches to
special interests in a short period of time
she's totally owned by wall street we believe in American is she believes in
globalism and it's not that she believes it
the people that give her all of this money believe in it and she'll believe
in whatever they want her to believe believe me that's it
what a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and my pants
Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy
radical Islam radical Islamic terrorism
you saw the other day with the truck screaming out the window you heard what
he was screaming out the window
you saw it in san bernardino you saw at the World Trade Center
you saw it in orlando
how horrible was that you saw in Paris
you see it all of and Hillary is a weak person
we are the law and order candidates and with the law and order party
we're going to change things around is going to be respected again for law and
order
yeah
Hillary Clinton's foreign policy helped launch Isis you know she's talking to
see the ng pinsan if I make one statement which is fine
she'll take that statement and put it on a totally dishonest and it's got a lot
of money because it's given to her by the lobbyists and by the speciality got
a lot of money but I see the ads on foreign policy she's talking about
Donald Trump doesn't have foreign policy experience of question that I've been
very very very successful business person
I mean all right but if you look at my calls
I said don't go into Iraq that we care because I was a business person was a
civilian take the oil many many calls I made you take a look I said that in
Scotland and in the UK that was going to happen
I was the one that predicted it and everybody said he's wrong is wrong
President Obama said if it happens they're going to get to the back of the
line which probably is one of the reasons they lost because I consider to
win I think it was a win for them actually because they don't want to be
told what to do and they don't want to be told that when people pour into the
country they have to take them even if they're not qualified even if they don't
have paperwork
even if they have no idea where they come from and I said that breaks it's
going to happen
I said that they are going to break away and everybody left at and the odds were
twenty percent and then when it happened
she took a Ned saying Oh Donald Trump said this or that but I'm the one that
said it was going to happen and some of the more fair reporters about thirty
percent doesn't
said he was right I appreciate that seventy percent didn't so that's okay
so Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy
so important now i think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike
and one of the reasons is party unity I have to be on so many people have said
party unity because I'm an outsider
I want to be an outside I think it's one of the reasons i won in a landslide one
in Lance is this wasn't close
yeah
now this wasn't this is a like in the history of the Republican Party history
with 17 people running have to understand other people ran against one
two and three with 17
we got I say we because I'm the messenger I'm a messenger doing a good
job but I'm a messenger
we got almost 14 million votes that's more than any other person in the
history of the Republican Party in the primary system running much more than
regular we love
that's more than Richard Nixon it's more than white the Eisenhower you want the
Second World War offer
pretty good more than the bushes but i need by a lot I don't mean by love
but that's the 70 people people don't ever say that
that means our message is unbelievable and I want to thank all of the loyal
people because I have such loyal unbelievable people and they displayed
that just yesterday in Cleveland
well it's going to be so amazing but they displayed it was on display
well we had this group of people who many of them i've known and i won't say
because for party unity i'll say they're wonderful people never tough they said
never talk no trouble we're going to win
they got crushed and they got crushed immediately because people want what
we're saying to happen
they're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals that has no borders
that has taxes that are through the roof
highest tax nation just about in the world that has regulations that don't
allow you to start a business
and destroy your business if you do stuff and by the way speaking of
destroying businesses we're going to take care of the miners and we're going
to take care of the steel ones
we're going to put it back so they're very tired but I want to thank all of
those people that delegates that were on the different committees because boy
would have said something
did we show them something and unfortunately the vote was very late but
essentially when a hundred and twelve - twelve this was the vote that was going
to put it onto the floor we're gonna have a big fight and I can have a fine
people agreeing with what we they want the wall
they want the borders they want these things to have and what we're doing and
what we're doing that I'm so proud so proud and nobody else would even think
about doing
I fought very hard for it will cause the jumps an amendment where he took away
from the evangelicals and I want to thank the evangelicals because without
the evangelicals i could not have one denomination the evangelicals have been
unbelievable
i dominated with evangelicals a lot of people were surprised they say he's not
perfect but you know what they know i'm gonna get the job done and it really
smart and I said
and I said for the evangelicals that we're gonna do something that nobody's
even tried to do you have the Johnson amendment passed by lyndon johnson and
his group and he was a powerful president he knew how to get things done
he got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him but he was
a powerful president and we call it the Johnson amendment where you are just
absolutely
tion if you're evangelical if you want to talk religion you lose your tax
exempt status
we put into the platform
we're going to get rid of that horrible
Johnson and we're going to let evangelicals we're gonna let Christians
and Jews and people of religion book without being afraid to talk i saw this
i had so many great leaders so many times up to my office
the top the absolute top evangelical leaders Christian leaders Jewish leaders
believe it or not some Muslim leaders were going to be surprised to hear that
i had the top leaves up to my office and I said why is it that you're so powerful
as an individual and yet when you get out there you sort of Kennedy and they
didn't know how to answer the question and it took two three meetings before I
think it one great great gentleman that everybody knows but whose name i will
not reveal said mr. Trump we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues
we live in fear that we're going to lose our tax exempt status we say anything
that's even slightly political and I looked out the windows in from town and
pointed two people walking down the street
I said well they have the right to speak but you don't that means they're more
powerful than you are
we have to do something about how did it start how did it start
and they said it started because of lyndon johnson and he actually had a
problem in Texas with a certain religious leader and he didn't have done
and we're going to want to do so that religious leaders in this country and
those unbelievable people and not because they backed me in such large
numbers but so that religion can again have a voice because religions voice has
been taken away
we're going to change back to my pets
so one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was i looked at Indiana and I want
Indiana big remember Indiana was going to be the firewall
that's where the truck was going down they agreed i win New York and
Pennsylvania when all these places but in the ad was going to be the firewall
so i got to study in the em and i got to study New York a lot of other places and
I saw him master signed by Bill Clinton has drained our manufacturing jobs
just bring us like we've never been drained before NAFTA again
sign by Bill Clinton nasta is the worst economic deal in the history of our
country
manufacturing down in some states fifty-five sixty percent
it's a harsh moving to Mexico moving to other places
I have a friend who is a great builder
what he built this place it's only does this bill plans
he doesn't build buildings he doesn't but he builds plants it's the biggest in
the world
from what I hear I said as businesses with him the other day has business
it was unbelievable I said really well i'm surprised why is it
believable because I think of them is building and discounted he said Donald
what we're doing in Mexico you won't believe the wedding
he said with building plans in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen
so what about this country not much not much
and the expression he said exactly that not much
I said but mexican he said you've never seen anything like it
it's incredible folks that's going to stop
we're going to go reversing we're going to bring our jobs back to this country
we can't be stupid and
and he was better than a pollster he's better than a consultant don't say how
are we doing and you get a big report that question millions of dollars
does it was me miss me I getting ten thousand dollars of course other people
millions cost other campaigns millions together every time they get a report
its millions but i'll tell you what a guy like this is better than anybody you
can hire to do a report and he said that he didn't say it from the same point of
he's said about it just that we don't
unbelievable in Mexico that he actually said I've never ever seen anything like
it interview up for is building massive plants there instead of Michigan we want
to development mission
they're gonna build a mission and you know that I know how to do that so easy
so easy but they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of
us without retribution
there are consequences when you fired thousands of people and move to another
country and then take you to make your product and sell it in here
there are consequences and those consequences are going to keep companies
in person and everybody here most wanted consequences are
but i won't say that because I'm like you are interested right now in
Indiana is unemployment rate and that's the primary reason i wanted my other
than he looks very good other then he's got incredible family credible wife and
family guarantees
highly respect expected to go for another four years you would have one
very easily and in the end
indiana their unemployment rate has fallen when he was there when he started
eight point four percent when he was governor when he took over to less than
five percent in may of 2016
since January 2013 Indiana's labor force has increased by more more than 186,000
jumped understand
I've got around to all these since I've got to love and every time I have
statistician
I said give me the steps on the state and it's always bad now
down down down forty percent fifty percent sixty percent in some cases
here's somebody where it's going up private sector job growth is up by more
than one hundred and forty-seven thousand jobs 2013 that's like very
unusual governor pence balance the budget
can you imagine a balanced budget our budget so out of whack in this time to
remember what we don't look at all
very soon 21 treated
balance the budget they don't know what that means
governor pence balance the budget produced a surplus and maintains a two
billion dollar reserve fund instead of India
it's also rated triple-a their bonds are ready to triple-a very states have that
Triple A the best that's as good as you can get
whether your company is it triple-a Indiana was recently recognized by chief
executive magazine as the number one state in the Midwest for business number
one and it's not even close
there are approximately thirty-four thousand fewer Hoosiers on unemployment
insurance now than they were when mike pence took office
so you have fewer illusions fewer people from in the end he said that Bobby
Knight my friend who really did help me and if you want a reference bobby knight
in indiana
we love Bobby Knight but he agrees with everything i'm saying he loves ago
Indiana is the second lowest unemployment rate in the nation for
veterans where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm funny of the veterans
the veterans have been left behind
you remember a few months ago Hillary Clinton said that really they're doing
much better the VA is much better
they're doing a much better job than people give it credit for people dying
in line waiting for 56 days to doctors
people are dying they can't even see that it's a scandal take a look at
what's happening with the VA in Arizona
take a look at what's happening with what you're just the Veterans
Administration hospitals
it's a scandal it's corrupt its incompetent
it's a scandal and Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine
and boy am I going to win big with the veterans
I mean we know that
so it's now 2.4% for veterans in 2013 when mike pence took office the rate for
veterans with 6.7 was thirty first in the nation
one of the bad ones and now it's almost the best jobs got them jobs
Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates
it's a great thing going to see you and Mike worked on him that he was telling
me that we studied under governor Pence is leadership Indiana enacted the
largest k-12 education funding increase in the state's history
so you're balancing budgets and yet you're giving more money to education is
that a great thing
Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America school
choices where attack you want to get this girl's got to get rid of common for
fast
governor pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the States History
thinking what cutting taxes and balancing budgets and along with
corporate tax reform just about number one in the country
she had be seen Frank Indian first in the nation for its enforcement
so with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets spending more
money on education and the instruction is kept up that had so much look as a
builder
nobody in the history of this country has ever known
so much about infrastructure Donald Trump I build infrastructure
- I know how to build a wall - I know how to build infrastructure
you know it's very interesting
we're building we're building i won the it's pretty amazing the Obama
administration but I won the right to have the old post office building on
Pennsylvania Avenue right near the White House and it's amazing probably the best
location one of the most sought-after projects in the history of the GSA
general service and i really like what's happened
we're going to have an opening very soon dvanken Eric and on did a fantastic job
but it but I thought the other day I was going over the numbers
we're under budget and about a year actually more than you but we're a year
ahead of schedule and we're under budget substantial and the quality of the work
is even better than we originally we're going to be and when I explain to a
government representatives that we're under budget and ahead of schedule they
almost fell off because they've never heard those words
so what I see what happened to Indiana which was having tremendous problems
when I see what happened to Indian under Mike's work also his predecessor did a
great job great teacher who's now we do
who's now at Purdue when I see what happened with respect to the numbers the
state and everything else that to me was probably the single most important
because it's something that hasn't happened almost has not happened in this
whole country to turn around and the strength of Indiana has been incredible
and I learned that when I campaign and I learned that when I want that state in a
lance and I learned that when Governor pence under tremendous pressure from
establishment people
endorse somebody else but it was more of an endorsement for me if you remember we
talked about Trump and he talked about Ted was a good guy by the way he's going
to be speaking at the convention that groups good guy but he talked about
Trump tell anyone I said what do you do this
so even though he was under pressure as i thought you know outside of the
establishment
it was the single greatest not an endorsement I've ever had
so with that I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be
outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States
Governor Mike Pence thank you thank you
on behalf of my family here and looking on
would you join me in thanking Donald Trump Milania and his entire family for
the sacrifices that they are making to make America great again
and I think Donald Trump the confidence you have placed in us and I accept your
invitation to run and serve as vice president of the united states of
america
now I come to this moment deeply humbled with a grateful heart grateful to god
for his amazing grace grateful to my wonderful wife Karen and are three
incredible kids Michael Charlotte and Audrey and grateful to this builder this
fire this patriotic American who is set aside a legendary career in business to
build a stronger America
Donald J Trump and he said that he had the privilege to spend time with this
man and his family out of the limelight
I know what all of America will soon know even better
these are good people Donald Trump is a good man and he will make a great
president of the united states of america
that'll jump understand the frustrations in the hopes of the American people like
no leader since Ronald rate the American people are tired
we're tired of being told we're tired of being told that this is as good as it
gets
we're tired of getting politicians in both parties in Washington DC
tell us we'll get to those problems tomorrow and is ronald reagan said we're
tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far distant
capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plant them for ourselves
Donald Trump gets it and he understands the American people
I truly am deeply humbled to be at his side today and when I got this call last
Wednesday I could only think of that ancient question who am i Lord and who
is my family that you brought us this far
so let me try and answer that question for a few minutes of people who know me
well know i'm a pretty basic guy i'm a christian conservative and republican in
that order
I currently have the privilege of serving the state that i love I'm really
I'm really just a small town boy grew up in southern Indiana with a big family in
a cornfield the backyard like Donald Trump my grandfather immigrated to this
country and in many ways I grew up with a front row seat to the American dream
I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters
a family of business and a good name
the heroes in my used for john f kennedy and the Reverend dr. Martin Luther King
jr. I actually started in politics and the other party when I came of age i was
inspired by the ideals and the eloquence of our 40th President and I became a
Republican most important thing in my life is in 31 years ago I married the
girl of my dreams Karen pence who will make a great second lady of the united
states of them
and while this office is an extraordinary office to wish to inspire
the highest role i will ever play is d-a-d and i'm a proud father of a
college student a graduate turned writer and the United States Marine
yeah
my career i ran for Congress before the republican revolution led by Newt
Gingrich in 1994 I wasn't successful
by the time i got elected to washington DC
sometimes i felt like i was elected after it was over from almost my first
day in Congress I found myself
battling the big spenders in both political parties whether opposing no
child left behind the prescription entitlement with Wall Street bail mama
bail out I bought every single day for taxpayers and fiscal responsibility when
I was a member of the Congress of the United States and after the republicans
lost to congress in 2006 i was actually unanimously elected to serve in
leadership and we fought back against the Nancy Pelosi Congress we opposed to
Obamacare
we oppose their tax increases we oppose their cap and trade and I was part of
the team that won the Congress back from democratic control in two thousand and
all that happened before i went back home again to Indiana but i want to say
I answer this call for two reasons first because I know from firsthand experience
that strong Republican leadership can bring about real change just like we've
seen in the Hoosier State and secondly because Hillary Clinton must never
become president of the United States of America
yeah
yeah
right
ok
and the first . know what I'm talking about
you know in Indiana we prove every day you can build a growing economy
unbalanced budgets low taxes even while making record investments in education
roads and health care
we like to say in the end state that works and it does Indiana works because
republican principles work every time you put them into practice today we have
a two billion dollar surplus in the highest credit rating in the nation and
since i became governor who's your businesses large and small have created
nearly a hundred and fifty thousand net new jobs and we have more Hoosiers going
to work than ever before in the 200-year history of the great state of Indiana
that's what republican leadership get you and let me say from my heart
that's what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald J Trump will bring to
Washington DC
collections about choices elections are about choices and I also join this
ticket because the choice could not be more clear
the stakes could not be higher Americans can choose a leader who will fight to
make America safe and prosperous again and bring real change or we can elect
someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington DC
seven and a half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have
weakened America's place in the world and stifle our nation's economy
terrorist attacks at home and abroad
grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few short days ago
the attempted coup in Turkey all tests to a world spinning apart
history teaches us that weakness arouses evil
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy of leading from behind
moving red lines
feigning reset with a resurgent Russia and the rise of Isis is a testament to
this truth of history and we must bring a change to American standing
we cannot have four more years of college izing to our enemies and
abandoning our friends
America needs to be strong for the world to be safe on the world stage
Donald Trump will lead from strength he will rebuild the arsenal of democracy
stand with our end our allies and hunt down and destroy the enemies of our
freedom and hold and hold the choice is just as clear for Donald Trump wants to
cut taxes Hillary Clinton plans to raise taxes on working families small
businesses and family farms where Donald Trump is committed to repeal Obamacare
lock stock and barrel
Hilary Clinton looks at Obamacare is a good start and wants to take Bernie
Sanders path down the single-payer socialized medicine where Donald Trump
supports an all-of-the-above strategy and will end the war on coal Hillary
Clinton actually promised an energy plan that would close
American coal mines and put coal miners out of work where Donald Trump wants to
build a wall and temporarily suspend immigration from countries compromised
by terrorism
Hillary Clinton plans to ignore the Supreme Court reimposed executive
amnesty and would increase increase our refugee program by more than five
hundred percent and where Donald Trump will appoint justices like the late
Antonin Scalia who will uphold our Constitution Hillary Clinton will
appoint Supreme Court justices who will legislate from the bench abandoned the
sanctity of life and rewrite our second amendment to every American who shares
our convictions
I say to you join us for the sake of our security for the sake of our prosperity
for the sake of a Supreme Court that will never turn its back on our
god-given liberties
let's come to get as a party and the people and the movement to make America
great again and that day begins when Donald Trump becomes the 45th President
of the United States of America
thank you for the honor thank you
